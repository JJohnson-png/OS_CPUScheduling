This is a java file containing many different CPU scheduling algorithms. To use 
it you can find the same of the algorithm you want, put the method name in main, 
and pass the number of processes that you want to test it with. The program will 
then prompt you for different numbers regarding arrival time and burst time. It 
will lastly display measurments indicating performance of the algorithm.

TO INSTALL:
Open your terminal and do command, git clone https://github.com/JJohnson-png/OS_CPUScheduling

Note:
This code could easily be improved upon and practically used in future projects 
for me. I kept it in a simple state in order to do this later in other school
projects.
